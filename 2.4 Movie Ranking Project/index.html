 <h3>Enola Holmes 1 & 2</h3>
<p> I loved this movie! It is a mystery staring Milly Bobby Brown as Enola Holmes, 
 the younger sister of the great detective Sherlock Holmes. She is tired of always being in her brother's shadow
 and when her mother disapears, she is ready to investigate!</p>


<h3> Fantastic Beasts 1, 2 & 3</h3>
 <p>I owe J.K Rowling so much for creating the wizarding world! It is the BEST! 
 These 3 movies tell the story of a time before Voldemort was the enemy. Newt Scamander
 and Albus Dumbledore must find a way to stop Grindleward from distroying their world and the 
 muggle world.</p>

<h3> That Christmas</h3>
 <p>This is definitely a good family movie to watch. It's a cartoon and tells the story of 
 Danny. He has just moved to Wellington on sea with his mum. It is told by santa.

 <h3>K-pop Demon Hunters</h3>
<p>This came out not long ago and is loved all around the world! It's got 
 lots of great songs and action too. It tells the story of a girl band called Huntrix.

 Can they stick together when Gwima sends demons to steal their fans?
