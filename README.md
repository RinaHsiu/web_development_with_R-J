Welcome to the web_development_with_R-J wiki!
in this repo, we are going to be learning about web development!

# Day 1 06/09/25

## Udemy
- udemy is the new website we are going to use to learn coding on. 
- it is run by Dr Angela Yu who is going to teach us
- Lets Go!

## the 12 rules of Coding
- the 12 rules of coding is 12 different rules that Angela has made for us!
- we will learn 1 every lesson

### Rule 1: Trick your Brain with the 20 minutes rule

**step 1: Task Switching**
task switching is a <ins>very hard</ins> thing to do! Why should I stop watching TV do to coding?

this is why the moment you step into your house and change the environment is so <ins>crucial</ins>! If you decide now to just do <ins>20</ins> mins of coding, you might end up doing <ins>more</ins>!

**step 2: Develop a habit**
try to choose a time where you just sit down and do coding. keep doing that for a month. to make it easier, you can keep a streak!

## the Internet
think of the internet as a long wire that connects computers together!
client => Internet service provider(e.g. BT, EE) => Domain Name system

### Code files

there are 3 types of code files:
- HTML </>
- CSS {...}
- JS </>
but why have all three? 

think of it this way, you are building a house.
- HTML would be the bricks that make the house
- CSS would be the paint and decorations of the house
- JS would be the electricity and water and the other functions of the house that makes it ok to live in.
or
- HTML is the human body though not alive
- CSS is the clothing and makeup that we wear to look prettier
- JS would be life
it is the same in programing! take google for example,
- HTML is the home page
- CSS is the color and design
- JS is the functions that allows you to search and click buttons

### How to get the most out of courses?

**1. the 10 mins rule**
instead of coding with the tutorial, just watched for 10 mins and try to understand the code and then try to recreate that code.

**2. Don't skip lessons**
skipping lessons could mean you miss out on some important imformation and could get stuck.

### How to get help when your stuck?
getting stuck is natural in coding! Everyone gets stuck, even the best programers! 

1. ask google or ai
2. go to Q&A section
   how to ask
      - what did you expect
      - what actually happened
      - screenshot of you code
      - screen shot of the debugging console

# Day 3 12/09/25

## Udemy

### HTML 

**The Heading element**
there are only <ins>6 heading</ins>. H1 to H6

<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<h6>Hello World!</h6>

h1 is the tag and the whole thing is the element
- don't have more than <ins>one</ins> h1
- don't skip levels

**Paragraph element**
<p> This is a paragraph </p>

without the paragraph element, everything will just look like this:

this is a paragraph this is a paragraph this is a paragraph
bad right?

with it though, it will look like this:

this is a paragraph

this is a paragraph

Lorem Ipsum - place holder text
when you are making a website, you don't have time to write what you actually want so we use Lorem Ipsum as a place holder. it will generate latin text that looks like a real paragraph. for more fun things, go to Bro Ipsum or Pirate Ipsum!

### Vs Code
this was also the first time I used Vs Code! Yay! it was really easy to understand and use

## what are my feelings
happy
proud
yay!

## What's next?
more!
