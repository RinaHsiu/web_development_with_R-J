# Day 1 06/09/25

## Udemy
- udemy is the new website we are going to use to learn coding on. 
- it is run by Dr Angela Yu who is going to teach us
- Lets Go!

## the 12 rules of Coding
- the 12 rules of coding is 12 different rules that Angela has made for us!
- we will learn 1 every lesson

### Rule 1: Trick your Brain with the 20 minutes rule

**step 1: Task Switching**
task switching is a <ins>very hard</ins> thing to do! Why should I stop watching TV do to coding?

this is why the moment you step into your house and change the environment is so <ins>crucial</ins>! If you decide now to just do <ins>20</ins> mins of coding, you might end up doing <ins>more</ins>!

**step 2: Develop a habit**
try to choose a time where you just sit down and do coding. keep doing that for a month. to make it easier, you can keep a streak!

## the Internet
think of the internet as a long wire that connects computers together!
client => Internet service provider(e.g. BT, EE) => Domain Name system

## Udemy

### Code files

there are 3 types of code files:
- HTML </>
- CSS {...}
- JS </>
but why have all three? 

think of it this way, you are building a house.
- HTML would be the bricks that make the house
- CSS would be the paint and decorations of the house
- JS would be the electricity and water and the other functions of the house that makes it ok to live in.
or
- HTML is the human body though not alive
- CSS is the clothing and makeup that we wear to look prettier
- JS would be life
it is the same in programing! take google for example,
- HTML is the home page
- CSS is the color and design
- JS is the functions that allows you to search and click buttons

### How to get the most out of courses?

**1. the 10 mins rule**
instead of coding with the tutorial, just watched for 10 mins and try to understand the code and then try to recreate that code.

**2. Don't skip lessons**
skipping lessons could mean you miss out on some important imformation and could get stuck.

### How to get help when your stuck?
getting stuck is natural in coding! Everyone gets stuck, even the best programers! 

1. ask google or ai
2. go to Q&A section
   how to ask
      - what did you expect
      - what actually happened
      - screenshot of you code
      - screen shot of the debugging console

# Day 3 12/09/25

## Udemy

### HTML 

**The Heading element**
there are only <ins>6 heading</ins>. H1 to H6

<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<h6>Hello World!</h6>

h1 is the tag and the whole thing is the element
- don't have more than <ins>one</ins> h1
- don't skip levels

**Paragraph element**
<p> This is a paragraph </p>

without the paragraph element, everything will just look like this:

this is a paragraph this is a paragraph this is a paragraph
bad right?

with it though, it will look like this:

this is a paragraph

this is a paragraph

Lorem Ipsum - place holder text
when you are making a website, you don't have time to write what you actually want so we use Lorem Ipsum as a place holder. it will generate latin text that looks like a real paragraph. for more fun things, go to Bro Ipsum or Pirate Ipsum!

### Vs Code
this was also the first time I used Vs Code! Yay! it was really easy to understand and use

## what are my feelings
happy
proud
yay!

## What's next?

### Void Elements
A void element has NO content

**Horizontal Rule**
<hr/> 
this is a void elemet because it has no content.
this creates a line

**Breack Element**
<br/>
this is also a c=void element because it has no content
this crates a new line is sometimes used in poems.

### Best Movies Project

# Day 5 19/09/25

## Udemy

### List Element 

**Unordered list**
<ul>
   <li>Milk</li>
   <li>Eggs</li>
   <li>Flour</li>
</ul>

an unordered list uses bullet points

**Ordered list**
<ol>
   <li>Milk</li>
   <li>Eggs</li>
   <li>Flour</li>
</ol>

an ordered list uses numbers

### Nesting and indentation
we can actually nest a list insode another list! this is where indentation becomes important.

**E.G**
<ul>
   <li>A</li>
   <li>B
      <ul>
         <li>B1</li>
      </ul>
   </li>
</ul>

**Life Hack**
Do the first list first then start to add the nested ones. it makes life SO MUCH EASIER!

## What are my feelings
- happy
- tired
- annoyed cause i had to type all this in twice

## Whats next?

# Day 6 21/09/25

## Udemy

### Anchor Element
The Anchor element allows us to create HyperLinks!

<a>This is a link</a>
this does NOT work!!!

you need to add an ATTRIBUTE

<a href="http://www.google.com">This is a link</a>

it will always be like this:

<tag then attribute then = then value>content</tag>

fun fact! 
- you can have more than one attribute!
- just seperate them with a space

**href**
<a href="dfhjakjhdfakhjgdsf">this link is created using href!</a>
- stands for "Hypertext Reference"
- used to go to other addresses(web pages, websites)

## What are my feelings
- tired
- happy because i made my first website with HyperLinks!
- ye

## What's Next?

### Image Element
the image element allows us to add images onto our website!

<img scr="url"/>
- scr is the source of image
- url is the location of the image
- it is a void element

  <img scr="url" alt="description"/>
  - we sometimes need to add a description for the image for blind people or people who need a screen reader.

  **Fun Fact**
  - url stands for
  - Uniform Resource Locator!
